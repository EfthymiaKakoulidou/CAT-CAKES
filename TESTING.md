## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files and since I have 2 CSS files I used the "direct input" option.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fcakes-by-kg) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.JPG) | Pass: No Errors |
| style-gallery.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fcakes-by-kg) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.JPG) | Pass: No Errors |


## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | About | Contact | Birthday Cakes | Speciallty Cakes | Sweet Treats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-home.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-about.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-contact.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-birthday-cakes.JPG)| ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-speciallty-cakes.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-sweet-treats.JPG) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-home.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-about.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-contact.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-birthday-cakes.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-speciallty-cakes.JPG) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-firefox-sweet-treats.JPG) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Bugs


- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug01.JPG)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug02.JPG)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug03.JPG)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /appname/path appname/template_name.html

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug04.JPG)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `E501 line too long` (93 > 79 characters)

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug04.JPG)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

## Unfixed Bugs


- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.JPG)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.JPG)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.JPG)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.


There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
