## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files and since I have 2 CSS files I used the "direct input" option.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fcakes-by-kg) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.jpg) | Pass: No Errors |
| style-gallery.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fcakes-by-kg) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.jpg) | Pass: No Errors |

## Bugs

![screenshot](documentation/bug.jpg)

I had this bug and to fix it I took away this line of code.

During peer review:
I was told to check the contrast which I did and fixed that by changing back to not change colour when hover.
Also my elements were a bit hidden under the navbar and I fixed that by adjusting their style attributes.
Another comment was that the navbar was squished when viewed on tablets and I fixed that by using the hamburger icon there too.

When I was testing with Lighthouse I got a warning that my aria-label on the logo-button should have the same text with text on the logo-button so I fixed that by puting the same text.
