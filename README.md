### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The colour I chose were inspired by the colours typically used for sweets that is pink(for sugar), brown(for chocolate) and white(for cream).

### Features
The website is comprised of 7 pages, the home page, the about page, the gallery page which consists of 4 pages one for every type of cakes and treats and a contact page. 

#### Accessibilty
We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text. This has been actioned in the footer of our project.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
