# [CAKES BY KG](https://efthymiakakoulidou.github.io/cakes-by-kg)


Cakes by KG is a website aiming to provide information about the services Katerina Glykou offers which are designing and baking cakes. Apart from the information, the project hopes to inspire the user in the process of chosing a cake. The target audience is people in the Stockholm region who need to order cakes. With the use of picture and contact information the target audience will be able to be inspired choose a cake and order it.

## UX

My aim was to create an accessible and easy-to-navigate website. I wanted it to be welcoming the user to enter a fun and sweet world.

### Colour Scheme

The choice of colours was based on we typically associate to sweet flavors. I chose pink for sugar, beige for cream, brown for chocolate and white. Because of the background image being so colourful I chose not use more colours to tone it down.

- rgb 68,33,22 - Dark brown -used for all text.
- rgb 255,182,193 - Lightpink - used for background to the header and as backround for the galleries so that the images there can be easily seen
- rgb 255,228,196 -Bisque - used for the logo and as background to the text having the needed contrast for accessibility.
.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/ffb6c1-ffe4c4-8b4513-e0ffff-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Accessibility

This site is accessible in the terms that it uses enough contrast between the text and its background, it is using semantics, alt attributes on all images and aria-label attributes where there is no text to define the section.

### Typography

I used 2 font-families for my project. One clean and readable for the whole site and one more graphic to create just the logo and titles (as an official logo does not exist yet.)

- [Shadows into light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light?query=shadow+) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Mako](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mako) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer, as an indication to the user to click on an image so that they can see more pictures of the same cake, and a burger icon serving the responsiveness needs.

## User Stories

As a user of this site I would like to be able to get inspired and order my cake. 

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to see pictures of cake, so that I can decide what I want.
- As a new site user, I would like to to have the option to describe my cake of choice, so that I can order a customized cake that will be exactly how I wanted it to be.
- As a new site user, I would like to like to be provided with contact information, so that I can make my order.


### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to see if the site has been updated, so that I can get more cake ideas.
- As a returning site user, I would like to be able to access the contact information, so that I can order again.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, and desktop sizes. The tablet sizes follow the mobile sizes layout.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
Although the final project might differ from the initial wireframes I kept the main concept intact and just added some features along the way where I thought they might be needed.

## Features

The project consists of 7 different pages:
The Home page : This is the first page that the user is going to meet. It welcomes the user and sets the tone for the experience he/she is going to have.
The About page : This page introduces the owner of the page so that the user gets information about the service-provider.
The Contact page : This page provides the contact details of the owner so that the user can easily get in touch with her.
The Gallery page : This page displays the work of the owner to show to user what kind of services they can expect. In here there are 3 categories from which the user can be directed to more specific areas of interest.
The birthday cakes page,
The Speciallty cakes and
The Sweet treats page.

### Existing Features

- The logo button :

    - The logo button is the expression of the whole graphic language of the site in the header. It has the owners initials on it and directs the user to the about page to learn more about the owner.

- The welcome link

    - This feature takes up the center and most important part of the page. It directs the user to the Gallery page which is the page of interest.

- The links to the gallery

    - Since the galleries are the most interesting part of the site I thought it would be nice to have direct links to them that are visible and clear on the home page.

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.JPG)

- The navigation bar with the dropdown menu

    - This feature is essential to the user. It is used to navigate the user to the diffrent pages of the site directly from the home page.

- The google maps i frame

    - This feature is used to show the location of the owner on the map since an address on its own may not provide the same amount of information to all the users.

![screenshot](documentation/feature07.JPG)

- The birthday cakes/speciallty cakes/sweet treats galleries

    - There are all of the images here. The user can click on the preview image of each cake and see it enlarged so they can study the details. Also more pictures of the same cake -hidden behind the preview picture - are provided for more information.

- Make your own cake feature
    - a feature that the user will be able to use his/hers imagination to constract a new cake and then get feedback from the owner. A menu of diffrent flavors will be provided.
