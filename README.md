# [CAKES BY KG](https://efthymiakakoulidou.github.io/cakes-by-kg)


Cakes by KG is a website aiming to provide information about the services Katerina Glykou offers which are designing and baking cakes. Apart from the information, the project hopes to inspire the user in the process of chosing a cake. The target audience is people in the Stockholm region who need to order cakes. With the use of picture and contact information the target audience will be able to be inspired chose a cake and order it.

## UX

My aim was to create an accessible and easy-to-navigate website. I wanted it to be welcoming the user to enter a fun and sweet world.

### Colour Scheme

The choice of colours was based on we typically associate to sweet flavors. I chose pink for sugar, beige for cream, brown for chocolate and white. I also chose a lightcyan color inspired by the colour of the cake used as background image.

- saddlebrown used for primary text.
- lightpink used for background to several parts.
- bisque used for the logo.
- bisque used for background to the pages that there is not a background image.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/ffb6c1-ffe4c4-8b4513-e0ffff-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I used 2 font-families for my project. One clean and redable for the whole site and one more graphic to create just the logo and titles (as an official logo does not exist yet.)

- [Shadows into light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light?query=shadow+) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Mako](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mako) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

As a user of this site I would like to be able to get inspired and order my cake.

- As a new site user, I would like to to have the option to describe my cake of choice, so that I can order a customized cake that will be exactly how I wanted it to be.
- As a new site user, I would like to like to be provided with contact information, so that I can make my order.


### Returning Site Users

## Wireframes

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features

The project consists of 7 different pages:
The Home page : This is the first page that the user is going to meet. It welcomes the user and sets the tone for the experience he/she is going to have.
The About page : This page introduces the owner of the page so that the user gets information about the service-provider.
The Contact page : This page provides the contact details of the owner so that the user can easily get in touch with her.
The Gallery page : This page displays the work of the owner to show to user what kind of services they can expect. In here there are 3 categories from which the user can be directed to more specific areas of interest.
The birthday cakes page
The Speciallty cakes
The Sweet treats page

### Existing Features

- The logo button :

    - The logo button is the expression of the whole graphic language of the site in the header. It has the owners initials on it and directs the user to the about page to learn more about the owner.

- The welcome link

    - This feature takes up the center and most important part of the page. It directs the user to the Gallery page which is the page of interest.

- The about link

    - This feature placed a little off center directs the user to the about page. It is essentially the logo button. In smaller screens the logo button disappears but the about-link stays so that we won't miss any information.

- The navigation bar with the dropdown menu

    - This feature is essential to the user. It is used to navigate the user to the diffrent pages of the site directly from the home page.

- The video feature

    - This feature is used to keep the interest of the user on the about page.

- The contact form

    - This feature is used to give to the user the opportunity to contact the owner directly from the site without having to leave the page.

    - This feature is used to show the location of the owner on the map since an address on its own may not provide the same amount of information to all the users.

- The birthday cakes/speciallty cakes/sweet treats galleries

    - There are all of the images here. The user can click on the preview image of each cake and see it enlarged so they can study the details. Also more pictures of the same cake -hidden behind the preview picture - are provided for more information.

### Future Features

In the future and with the scenario that business goes well for the owner it would br helpful to add 

- Prices for the cakes

    - this will give the user the opportunity to pay for the cake online.
- Make your own cake feature
    - a feature that the user will be able to use his/hers imagination to constract a new cake and then get feedback from the owner. A menu of diffrent flavors will be provided.
